# -PUA-Delhi-UI_Food_Waste_Control
As the demand for food banks rises Basic Idea was to Reduce Food Wastage. Community fridges could "take a lot of pressure off the food banks People in the community, no matter who they are, if they find themselves struggling, are able to take advantage of this fridge, Community can donate food directly to the fridge or fund it with spare change. Fridge asks for proof that people who use the fridge are receiving help from the government before allowing them to take two items of food per day. One of the good thing about this Fridge is access all hours. There are a lot more access hours to a community fridge than food banks. My vision is to Provide food for all the poor people who need it most which can help tackle the underlying causes of poverty. Community fridges cannot always offer the food which would sustain people through a crisis, as they rely on people donating what they do not need. "I feel there are a lot of gaps and community shops could fill those gaps. "Small businesses only survive because the community supports them. When you as a business appreciate that and give back, it makes you totally complete within the community you serve."  it will work on RPA so whenever the Community Fridge is empty it will send Email or Text Msg to the community that fridge is empty and we need food.
